Bug 11 (Bug #45605)
------------------------------

------------------------------
Description
------------------------------

Apache httpd Server

https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=45605

------------------------------
Relevant Functions
------------------------------


ap_queue_info_set_idle (in server/mpm/worker/fdqueue.c)
ap_queue_info_wait_for_idler (in server/mpm/worker/fdqueue.c)

------------------------------
Makefile Targets
------------------------------

build - initial build of the Apache

sleep - puts sleeps and logic make bug more likely to appear (bug is still
fairly rare).

fuzz - puts only randomized sleeps to make bug more likely to appear

normal - standard build

clean - removes build

------------------------------
Running Apache
------------------------------

To Launch the browser as a foreground process, I do the following:

$ /home/najalber/mt-testing/Benchmarks/bug11/bin/install/bin/httpd -DNO_DETACH -DFOREGROUND

My build scripts automatically configure apache to listen on port 8091, so you
can check to make sure it's working by navigating to http://localhost:8091

UPDATE:

I was getting this error when I ran Apache:

httpd: Could not reliably determine the server's fully qualified domain name, using 127.0.1.1 for ServerName
[Mon Oct 11 16:44:43 2010] [emerg] (28)No space left on device: Couldn't create accept lock

Probably due to memory leaks/unclean shutdowns, apache leaves a mess of semaphore arrays.  I cleaned them up by executing the following:

$ ipcs -s | xargs ipcrm sem

-------------------------------
Bug Testharness
------------------------------

Once Apache is running, execute the included load simulator to stress the
server:

$ bin/install/bin/ab -c 100 -t 30 http://localhost:8091/

-------------------------------
Bug 
-------------------------------

Read comment 4 for a detailed description.  At a high level, a condition
variable is used incorrectly (inside an if statment instead of a while loop),
which can lead to the request-listener thread getting out of synch with the
worker threads.  Eventually the listener will overwrite memory it's not
supposed to.

Alternately--The lack of atomicity between increasing the idler's count and
signal the listener thread could also considered at fault.

-------------------------------
Bug Manifestation
-------------------------------

When the bug manifests, the benchmarking program may fail like this:

-----
$ bin/install/bin/ab -c 100 -t 30 http://localhost:8091/
This is ApacheBench, Version 2.3 <$Revision: 655654 $>
Copyright 1996 Adam Twiss, Zeus Technology Ltd, http://www.zeustech.net/
Licensed to The Apache Software Foundation, http://www.apache.org/

Benchmarking localhost (be patient)
apr_socket_recv: Connection reset by peer (104)
Total of 61 requests completed
-----

And the bin/install/logs/error_log will have an entry similar to this:

-----
httpd: Could not reliably determine the server's fully qualified domain name, using 127.0.1.1 for ServerName
[Tue Sep 28 13:41:12 2010] [notice] Apache/2.2.9 (Unix) configured -- resuming normal operations
[Tue Sep 28 13:41:22 2010] [notice] child pid 7556 exit signal Segmentation fault (11)
-----

Sometimes you will see the following errors in the log, and I suspect these are
also manifestations of the bug:
-----
[Wed Oct 06 11:02:16 2010] [emerg] (22)Invalid argument: ap_queue_info_set_idle failed. Attempting to shutdown process gracefully.
[Wed Oct 06 11:02:17 2010] [emerg] (22)Invalid argument: ap_queue_info_set_idle failed. Attempting to shutdown process gracefully.

[Wed Oct 06 11:02:24 2010] [warn] child process 14152 still did not exit, sending a SIGTERM
[Wed Oct 06 11:02:24 2010] [warn] child process 13249 still did not exit, sending a SIGTERM
[Wed Oct 06 11:02:26 2010] [warn] child process 14152 still did not exit, sending a SIGTERM
[Wed Oct 06 11:02:26 2010] [warn] child process 13249 still did not exit, sending a SIGTERM
[Wed Oct 06 11:02:28 2010] [error] child process 14152 still did not exit, sending a SIGKILL
-----

Note, the bug results in a write off the array into arbitrary memory, so the
manifestation vary from run to run and platform to platform.  Also, bug
manifests quite rarely even with sleeps.
