------------------------------
Bug 10 (Bug #44402)
a.k.a. Apache-1
------------------------------

------------------------------
Description
------------------------------

Apache httpd Server

https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=44402

------------------------------
Relevant Functions
------------------------------

ap_queue_info_set_idle() (in server/mpm/worker/fdqueue.c)

------------------------------
Makefile Targets
------------------------------

build - initial build of the Apache

sleep - puts sleeps and wrapper functions to make bug more likely to appear

normal - standard build

clean - removes build

------------------------------
Running Apache
------------------------------

To Launch the browser as a foreground process, I do the following:

$ MALLOC_CHECK_=3 /home/najalber/mt-testing/Benchmarks/bug10/bin/install/bin/httpd -DNO_DETACH -DFOREGROUND 

My build scripts automatically configure apache to listen on port 8090, so you
can check to make sure it's working by navigating to http://localhost:8090

-------------------------------
Bug Testharness
------------------------------

Once Apache is running, execute the shell script to simulate parallel loads.

$ /home/najalber/mt-testing/Benchmarks/bug10/scripts/apache_request.sh

-------------------------------
Bug 
-------------------------------

See comment 17 from the bug report for a more detailed explanation.  At a high
level, a lock free list structure is being modified with atomic operations,
but the synchronization is not quite correct which can lead to list corruption
in highly concurrent scenarios.


-------------------------------
Bug Manifestation
-------------------------------

When the bug manifests, one of the child threads dies.  Check the error logs
after running the test harness (bin/install/logs/error_log).  If you see the
following, the bug occurred:

[Mon Sep 27 16:57:21 2010] [notice] Apache/2.2.8 (Unix) configured -- resuming normal operations
